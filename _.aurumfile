# This is an example .aurumfile, it contains all the info needed for aurum to
# keep track of where all its instances are stored. This is meant to be stored
# in $HOME/.aurumfiles. Each line looks like this:
# "$BOTNAME","/absolute/path/to/bot/elf","$TMUX_WINDOW"
# if $TMUX_WINOW is -1, that means the assosiated $BOTNAME is not running
